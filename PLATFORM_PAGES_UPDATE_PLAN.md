# Platform Pages & Menu Update Plan for Full GCP Audit Coverage

## Objective
Update the CloudAuditPro platform's pages, main menu, and submenus to fully reflect the comprehensive GCP audit suite, ensuring every audit area is discoverable and actionable from the UI.

## 2. Menu & Navigation Recommendations
- **Main Menu:**
  - Dashboard
  - BigQuery Audit
  - Storage Audit
  - Composer/Airflow Audit
  - Pub/Sub Audit
  - SQL Audit
  - Scheduler Audit
  - Network Audit
  - Recommendations
  - Cross-Project Audit
  - Label Consistency
  - Advanced Audits
- **Submenus:**
  - Each audit page should have submenus/tabs for its major checks (see table above).
  - Recommendations page should highlight high-priority actions from all audits.

---

## 3. Implementation Checklist

## 4. Notes
- This plan should be reviewed with design/UX before implementation.
- All changes should be made in the `update-platform-pages-for-full-audit` branch.
- After implementation, update onboarding and help docs to match new navigation.
- All pages from AUDIT_ITEM_PAGE_MAPPING.md are now present in the sidebar/main menu, including the new BigQuery submenu item for Slot Utilization & Reservation Sizing.

## AuditFlow Platform Page Completion Plan

### 1. Mapping Summary
A comprehensive mapping of all GCP audit items to platform pages has been completed (see `AUDIT_ITEM_PAGE_MAPPING.md`). This revealed several audit items that are not currently represented in the UI and require new pages or sub-pages for full coverage.

### 2. Missing Pages/Sub-Pages for Full Audit Coverage
The following pages/sub-pages are missing and must be implemented:

- Compute Resources
  - Granular VM Right-Sizing & Customization
  - Sole-Tenant Node Efficiency Review
  - Optimize Machine Image Storage Costs
- Kubernetes (GKE)
  - GKE Workload (Pod) Right-Sizing
  - GKE Idle/Underutilized Node Pool Detection
- Serverless
  - Cloud Functions Resource & Concurrency Optimization
  - Cloud Run Resource & Concurrency Optimization
- Storage
  - Persistent Disk Type & Snapshot Cost-Effectiveness
  - Filestore Instance Optimization
- Networking
  - Network Service Tier Analysis (Egress Costs)
  - Cloud NAT Gateway Efficiency
  - Inter-Region/Zone Traffic Cost Analysis
  - Cloud CDN for Egress Optimization
- Cost Management
  - Dormant/Unused Projects Review
  - Holistic CUD/SUD Coverage Analysis
  - Flexible CUDs vs. Resource-based CUDs Strategy
- BigQuery
  - BigQuery Storage API Cost Monitoring
  - BigQuery Slot Utilization & Reservation Sizing

### 3. Implementation Plan

**Step 1: Design & UX**
- For each missing page/sub-page, design a modern, user-friendly interface following the CloudAuditPro design system and UX best practices.
- Include clear navigation, summary cards, tables, charts, and actionable recommendations as appropriate.
- Ensure each page supports project selection and dynamically loads data for the selected project.

**Step 2: Data Integration**
- Integrate each new page with backend audit data, ensuring real-time or on-demand fetching for the selected project.
- Use existing API endpoints or create new ones as needed for each audit item.
- Display audit results, findings, and recommendations in a clear, actionable format.

**Step 3: Navigation & Menu Updates**
- Update the main menu and submenus to include all new pages/sub-pages.
- Ensure logical grouping and discoverability for all audit areas.

**Step 4: Testing & Documentation**
- Add unit and integration tests for each new page.
- Document the purpose, usage, and data flow for each page.
- Provide example screenshots and user flows in the documentation.
