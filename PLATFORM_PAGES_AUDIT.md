## Conclusion

This audit reveals several areas requiring standardization across the CloudAuditPro platform. While the application provides core functionality, significant improvements in component consistency, accessibility, and responsive behavior are needed. By implementing the recommended design system standards and following the prioritized roadmap, we can create a more cohesive, accessible, and maintainable user experience.

The most critical issues to address are:
1. Form accessibility and validation patterns
2. Consistent component usage across pages
3. Responsive layout standardization
4. Loading state and error handling patterns
5. Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

By focusing on these areas, we can dramatically improve both the developer experience and end-user satisfaction while ensuring compliance with accessibility standards.
