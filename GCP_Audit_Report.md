  - **Check:** Review deployment configurations
  - **Purpose:** Verify deployment configurations for security and efficiency.
  - **Inputs Required:** Deployment configuration data.
  - **Expected Output:** Deployment configuration review report.
  - **Classification:** Performance, Security.

## Gaps and Recommendations
- **Previously Missing Checks (Now Implemented):**
  - **BigQuery: Stale Partitioning** _(Implemented)_
    - This check is now implemented and will report tables with stale partitions for cost and performance optimization.
  - **Deprecated SQL UDFs** _(Implemented)_
    - This check is now implemented and will report deprecated UDFs for performance and compliance improvement.

## Conclusion
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current audit checks and highlights areas for improvement. The previously identified gaps for BigQuery stale partitioning and deprecated SQL UDFs have now been addressed and implemented, resulting in improved audit coverage and more robust GCP governance.
