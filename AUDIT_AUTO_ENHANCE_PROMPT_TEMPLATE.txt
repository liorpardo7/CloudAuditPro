# Audit Auto-Enhance Prompt Sequence Template: /cost

## Step 1: Context
- **Category/Page:** Cost
- **GCP API Endpoint(s):**
  - /api/cost
  - /api/cost-allocation
  - /api/discounts
  - /api/monitoring
  - /api/budgeting
  - [Add any additional relevant endpoints]
- **Raw API Response (JSON):**
```
[Paste the full raw JSON response from the /cost audit here]
```

## Step 2: Field Discovery
- **Extract and list all unique fields (including nested fields) from the raw response.**
- **Highlight any fields not currently mapped in the UI or inventory.**

## Step 3: Field Mapping & Suggestions
- **For each new/unmapped field:**
  - Suggest possible metrics, charts, or table columns.
  - Suggest aggregation or transformation if relevant.
  - Suggest if the field is actionable (can drive a recommendation).

## Step 4: Metrics/Charts/Recommendations Planning
- **Based on all available fields, propose:**
  - The most impactful and accurate metrics for this category/page.
  - The most useful charts/visualizations (with chart type suggestions).
  - Actionable recommendations that can be generated from the data.

## Step 5: Implementation Plan
- **Summarize the changes to make in the codebase (backend and frontend) to surface new fields, metrics, and recommendations.**
- **List any new UI components or backend logic needed.**
